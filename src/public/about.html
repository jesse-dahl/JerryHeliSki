          </h3>
          <div class="aboutBusiness">Jerry first got into this business by going up to Valdez Alaska one of the first years they had heli-skiing. He was the first person to start carrying a rope for the glacier travel. After a week of Heliskiing, the owner of the Tsaina Lodge, in Valdez Alaska, asked Jerry to guide his next clients, who were the movie crew for Warren Miller. From then on, Jerry started his own heli-skiing business and he now guides in Alaska and Chile.
